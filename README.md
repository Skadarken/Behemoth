# Behemoth
Text Based Fantasy Game

This is my attempt to combine two of my passions : Programming and Writing
It is an attempt to see if I can recreate the 'Bandersnatch' Netflix movie
My primary reason, on the other hand, is to create the largest logic flow and decision tree branch I possibly can, across multiple files and platforms.

Those interested, Join me for a coding blast of epic proportions and, hopefully, create a full game that will put every other Text Based Adventure to shame
