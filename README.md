# Behemoth
## Text Based Fantasy Game

This is my attempt to combine two of my passions : Programming and Writing; in an attempt to recreate the effect of the 'Bandersnatch' movie available on Netflix. (Check it out. Execution needed work but damn was it worth the wait)
My primary reason, on the other hand, is to create the largest logic flow and decision tree branch I possibly can to truly build an RPG where your choices drive your story.

Let me put it this way. The story will have multiple paths for a single chapter and even dedicated chapters for many branches and your ability to affect the events, characters and world around increases based on the number of branches I add. In effect, you write the story of your character by responding with a simple query: yes or no.

Those interested in making their mark on the gaming scene, Join me for a coding blast of epic proportions and, hopefully, code a choice driven game that will put every other Text Based Adventure to shame
