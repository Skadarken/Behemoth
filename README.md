# Behemoth
Text Based Fantasy Game

This is my attempt to combine two of my passions : Programming and Writing; in an attempt to recreate the effect of the 'Bandersnatch' movie available on Netflix. (Check it out. Execution needed work but damn was it worth the wait)
My primary reason, on the other hand, is to create the largest logic flow and decision tree branch I possibly can to truly build an RPG where your choices drive your story.

The each chapter contains a series of choices that determines your position relative to the storyline, your relationship with the other characters and the items available for you to progress your quest in a non-linear manner.

INSTRUCTIONS:
 I)Clone or download the zip file.
 II)Open 'Chapter01 - The Woods.py' with a Python IDE and Run the program. Alternatively, you may Run the program directly from the   command line
 III)The Game begins with a small introduction and offers you the choice to begin the game
