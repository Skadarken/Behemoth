My current common function for branching choices
    i = 0
    while True:
        choice = input()
        if(choice.isalpha()):
            if(choice.lower() == 'y'):
                FUNCTION()
            elif (choice.lower() == 'n'):
                print('')
                FUNCTION()
            else:
                print('You would make a poor follower. Choose Wisely\nY/N?')
                i += 1
        if(i>3):
            print('Four chances and you have chosen poorly. Begone from this realm\n')
            sleep(3.0)
            exit()
